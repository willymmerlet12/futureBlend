          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other

        <p>
          Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
          limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
          means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In such
          states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent
          permitted by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer: <br /> The Service is provided
          to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," with all faults and defects,
          without any warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by
          applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
          Affiliates, licensors, and service providers, expressly disclaims all
          warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, with
          respect to the Service. This includes all implied warranties of
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and
          non-infringement, as well as warranties that may arise from course of
          dealing, course of performance, usage, or trade practice. The Company
          provides no warranty or undertaking and makes no representation of any
          kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any
          intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,
          applications, systems, or services, operate without interruption, meet
          any performance or reliability standards, or be error-free.
          Additionally, the Company does not warrant or represent that any
          information or content provided through the Service is accurate,
          reliable, or current, or that the Service, its servers, the content,
          or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses,
          scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, time bombs, or other harmful
          components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
          warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
          consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
          not apply to You. In such cases, the exclusions and limitations set
          forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law.

          effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
          performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver of a breach
          constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
        </p>
